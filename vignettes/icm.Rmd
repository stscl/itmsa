## 1. The principle of the information consistency-based measures

$$
I_{N}\left(d,s\right) = \frac{I \left(d,s\right)}{I \left(d\right)} = 
\frac{I \left(d\right) - I \left(d \mid s\right)}{I \left(d\right)} = 
1 - \frac{\sum_{s_i \in S}\sum_{x \in V_d} p\left(s_i,x\right) \log p\left(x \mid s_i\right)}{\sum_{x \in V_d} p\left(x\right) \log p\left(x\right)}
$$

where $p\left(x\right)$ is the probability of observing $x$ in $U$, $p\left(s_i,x\right)$ is the probability of observing $s_i$ and $x$ in $U$, and $p\left(x \mid s_i\right)$ is the probability of observing $x$ given that the stratum is $s_i$.
